# TIcTiacToe_TOP
The Tic Tac Toe game from TOP curriculum

- The game is almost complete except the fact that the play again logic is set to refresh the page instead of reseting the marks and the board.
- The methods to reset already exist and the funcionality will implemented later.
- This only hinders the UX if the user intend to play it offline after initial game load.
- The lack of reset also limits the user of custom names and score keep on multiple rounds which are yet to be implemented.
